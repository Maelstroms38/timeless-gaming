# Role Playing Games

Told in the context of fantasy worlds, Role Playing Games prompt players to "level up" their skills and equipment in order to get to more advanced stages.

## The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

Like many Role Playing Games, The Witcher begins with a quest. Geralt of Rivia is a professional demon hunter. In his travels, he searches for his missing apprentice, Ciri. 

The game story follows a Polish novel with the same name. The Witcher also takes [inspiration](https://planpoland.com/realplacesinthewitcher/) from several Polish towns. Whether traveling by foot, horse or boat, I found myself curious to discover more characters and quests.

With many open-world choices to make, your decisions during conversations can open or close doors. Challenging players to think about choices is a genre-defining feature. The Witcher does not disappoint to this end, as some choices determine who lives or dies. 

In one series of choices you are allowed to orchestrate a play for the local townsfolk. Your choices will determine the play's performance, as Geralt is cast with a starring role.

The game unfolds with a nordic theme, as you visit distant fjords to unravel more mysteries. Each mission features robust, engaging elements to keep players on their toes. 

Even without experience playing the first two installments, The Witcher 3 caught my attention early. It stands out with player-driven storytelling. CD Projekt Red, the team behind The Witcher series, pulls new players in from the beginning.
