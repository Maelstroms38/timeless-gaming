# Real Time Strategy

Rather than present turn-based style, Real Time Strategy, or RTS games use live in-game events. The rapid speed of in-game events prompt players to adapt quickly, or lose their advantage against opponents.

## Age of Empires II

Imagine a world of your own creation. In Age of Empires, the world below begins as a desolate wasteland. In your hands it may flourish into a vast kingdom.

Over yonder, foreign kingdoms seek prominence over the land. Their struggle becomes your strife, as you both seek to hold sway over newfound territory. 

As a younger lad, my first exposure to Age of Empires was at my friend Jonathan's apartment. He and I would grow from the rural farmlands, build training barracks and raise armies to wage wars. 

As a history lesson, Age of Empires II shows players how the world evolved, with each age introducing new technology. The Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age include an exciting twist on their advances. In the Castle Age, you can construct seige engines to tear enemy castles down.

After playing several rounds, I would resort to cheat codes. Cheat codes add plenty of hijinks into the arena, like a red convertible that fires bullets. 

[Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/aoeiide/) will restore the original version with a fresh coat of paint. Looking forward to returning to The Age of Kings!
